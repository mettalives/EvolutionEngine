**EvolutionEngine** is a high-performance, object-oriented **real-coded Genetic Algorithm (GA) framework** in C++.  
It supports **SBX crossover**, **polynomial mutation**, and **tournament selection**, with built-in **elitism**, **adaptive mutation**, and configurable **minimization or maximization** goals.  

Track key GA metrics including **best fitness, average fitness, and population diversity**, and optionally **seed** runs for reproducibility. Ideal for **real-valued optimization problems**, research, and experimentation in evolutionary computation.

## Features

- Real-coded GA with **floating-point genes**  
- **SBX (Simulated Binary) crossover** & **Polynomial mutation**  
- **Tournament selection**  
- **Elitism** support  
- Configurable **mutation/crossover probabilities**  
- Configurable **minimization/maximization goals**  
- Tracks **population statistics**: best, average, diversity  
- Optional **random seed** for reproducible experiments  
- Fully modular: easily swap **selection**, **crossover**, or **mutation** strategies
